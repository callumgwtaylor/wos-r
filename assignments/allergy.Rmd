## Introduction

In this dataset we provide you two tables with admission details for critical care, with the following:

- Patient ID
- Admission Number
- Allergy Status

- Patient ID
- Admission Number
- Outcome


## Questions We Want Answered

The first aim of this dataset is it will get you to join together two tables.

Once that is done, you will be able to see which admissions did not have allergy status recorded.

What proportion of admissions had no drug allergy recorded?

What allergies were most frequently recorded?

Do any allergies appear to have different unit outcomes?
